## üì¶ System Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**
   Admin configures basic website information (name, contact) and inputs master data (brands, categories, cars, extras, coupons) via the **Admin Panel**.

2. **Booking Process by Customer**
   Customer selects a car from the **Catalog**, chooses dates and extras on the **Car Detail Page**, then fills in personal details and selects payment method on the **Checkout Page**.

3. **Payment & Confirmation**

   * **Online Payment**: Customers pay via **Midtrans pop-up**. Once successful, booking status is automatically set to `confirmed`.
   * **Manual Bank Transfer**: Customers receive instructions. *Staff* verifies payment and updates booking status manually in **Admin/Staff Dashboard**.
   * **Pay on Delivery**: Booking is directly `confirmed`, and staff records payment when the car is picked up.

4. **Staff Management**
   *Staff* monitors new bookings, updates rental statuses (e.g., from `confirmed` to `on_rent`), and ensures car availability is accurate.
