## üì¶ System Workflow

1.  **Browsing & Selection**
    * A customer visits the website, browses the car catalog, and uses filters to find a suitable vehicle.
    * The customer selects a car and proceeds to the detail page to view specifications and pricing.

2.  **Calculation & Booking**
    * The customer selects the pickup and drop-off dates and times. The system automatically calculates the total rental cost.
    * The customer proceeds to the checkout page, where they are prompted to log in or register if they don't have an account.

3.  **Payment & Confirmation**
    * The customer fills in their personal details, uploads documents, and chooses a payment method (Midtrans, Manual Transfer, or Pay on Site).
    * Once the booking is confirmed (either automatically by Midtrans or via manual verification by staff), the system sends a **booking confirmation email** to the customer.
    * During development, all outgoing emails are routed to a **Mailtrap Inbox** for safe testing.

4.  **Management by Staff/Admin**
    * The staff receives a notification for the new booking.
    * The staff verifies the payment (if manual) and updates the booking status to "Confirmed".
    * The staff updates the status of the booked vehicle to "Rented" for the specified period.

5.  **Rental & Return Process**
    * The customer picks up and returns the vehicle according to the schedule.
    * Upon completion, the staff updates the booking status to "Completed" and the vehicle's status back to "Available".

6.  **Customer Reviews**
    * After a booking is completed, the customer can provide a rating and review for the rented car through their dashboard.
    * Reviews are moderated by staff/admins before being displayed on the public pages.
